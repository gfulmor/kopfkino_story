Frau Melhase and I were heading to the Rammstein concert in our Porsche when she told me that we had forgotten our lederhose and bratwurst. 
We decided to go back to retrieve them and also to grab some brot, so we made a u-turn and went back down the hauptstrasse. 
We stopped by the baeckerei to get the brot, and decided to also get some gebaeck and apfelkuchen. 
After getting home and retrieving our lederhose, we decided to bring our hund and got back into our porsche. 
It got hot in the porsche so I turned on the klimmaanlage.
We arrived at the concert a few hours early so we decided to go to a nearby biergarten for a drink and a snack before heading inside.
There are many great biergartens near the concert venue, all very wettbewerbsfashig to serve the best bier in town.
This biergarten was particularly fun because it was hund-friendly. 
My family and I went to the biergarten for bratwurst, brot, and apelkuchen.
I saw a hund on the way to the flighafen, but when I arrived there were no flights to Berlin.
In addition to being hund-friendly, Frau Mehlhase and I were impressed that the biergarten was decorated like a fancy schloss.
